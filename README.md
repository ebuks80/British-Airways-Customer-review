This project are tasks i worked on while running a British Airways data science intern job simulation. in here i scraped cystomer reviews from Skytrax, i cleaned the data and performed sentiment analysis to get useful insight from the customers, i made some visualisations to my findings that makes it more interesting and interactive. 
On the second task, i was given customer booking data and made to build a predictive model to predicting a customer booking a flight with British Airways and to get the most useful predictors.
